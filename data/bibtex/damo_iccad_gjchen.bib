abstract = {Continuous scaling of the VLSI system leaves a great challenge on manufacturing, thus optical proximity correction (OPC) is widely applied in conventional design flow for manufacturability optimization. Traditional techniques conduct OPC by leveraging a lithography model but may suffer from prohibitive computational overhead. In addition, most of them focus on optimizing a single and local clip instead of addressing how to tackle the full-chip scale. In this paper, we present DAMO, a high performance and scalable deep learning-enabled OPC system for full-chip scale. It is an end-to-end mask optimization paradigm that contains a deep lithography simulator (DLS) for lithography modeling and a deep mask generator (DMG) for mask pattern generation. Moreover, a novel layout splitting algorithm customized for DAMO is proposed to handle full-chip OPC problem. Extensive experiments show that DAMO outperforms state-of-the-art OPC solutions in both academia and industrial commercial toolkit.},
